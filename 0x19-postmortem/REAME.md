_Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error
After any outage a **postmortem**  a tool widely used in the tech industry is impelemented.A summary that has two main goals

1.To provide the rest of the companyâ€™s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.

2And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.
