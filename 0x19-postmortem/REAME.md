****POSTMORTEM PROJECT****

_Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error
After any outage a **postmortem**  a tool widely used in the tech industry is impelemented.A summary that has two main goals_

1.To provide the rest of the companyâ€™s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
