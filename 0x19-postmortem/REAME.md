****POSTMORTEM PROJECT****:The Great Python Tango Outage

_Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error
After any outage a **postmortem**  a tool widely used in the tech industry is impelemented.A summary that has two main goals_

1.To provide the rest of the companyâ€™s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.


2. And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.

We interrupt your regularly scheduled programming to bring you the gripping tale of "The Great Python Tango Outage" - a story of missteps, misconfigurations, and a little bit of mayhem.

****Duration****: January 25, 2024, 08:00 - 20:00 (EAT)

****Impact****: Picture this: an isolated Ubuntu 20.04 container running an Apache server, expecting smooth sailing, but suddenly, all it got was a wild ride of 500 Internal Server Errors. It's like expecting a sweet serenade and getting a cat playing the accordion instead. Not cool. All users suffered through the cacophony for a good 12 hours.

****Root Cause and Resolution:****

****Root Cause:**** Misconfiguration in Apache server settings resulted in the incorrect handling of Python scripts, leading to 500 Internal Server Errors.
